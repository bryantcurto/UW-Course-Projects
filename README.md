# UW-Course-Projects
Course projects from my time at the University of Waterloo.
Links to code can usually be found at the end of each paper.


For whoever happens to read this:

I had a lot of fun working on [my course project for CS656](https://github.com/bryantcurto/UW-Course-Projects/blob/master/fall2020/cs656-Computer-Networks/cs656.pdf), which is an attempt to adapt Redis to use io_uring for client communication.
I also enjoyed [my course project for CS798](https://github.com/bryantcurto/UW-Course-Projects/blob/master/winter2021/cs798-Multicore-Programming/cs798.pdf), which was an attempt to improve throughput of Redis by using relaxed, concurrent queues.
